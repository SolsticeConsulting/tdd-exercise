# tdd-exercise
This is an exercise to introduce a developer to TDD.

* Create a Set in TDD fashion
* The Set (MySet) will mimic the [Set](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/util/Set.html) interface of the java collections api
* You cannot use any of the Java Collections API

The [MySetTest](https://github.com/SolsticeConsulting/tdd-exercise/blob/main/src/test/java/MySetTest.java#L9) has been created for you. You will be working with another developer in a mentoring capacity to work through this exercise.
* The test contains compile errors as it references a class (MySet) that does not exist
* Use the IDE to create 'MySet,' the test is driving us to create the class
* Use the IDE to create the 'isEmpty' and 'size' methods, again the test is driving us to create the methods
* Work with the mentor to add additional functionality
* Do not commit or push to this project
